## Question
In the 1960s, during the height of the Cold War, the US suspected that the the Soviet Union would violate the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and attempt to secretly test nuclear weapons. So, in 1967, the US launched the Vela satellites which collected data on gamma radiation pulses emitted by nuclear weapon tests. Later that year, the satellites detected a flash of gamma radiation, unlike any emission from known nuclear weapons. In fact, it was not even coming from the Earth's direction. What were some of the proposed theories to explain these gamma ray bursts?


## IDK: 
There were hundreds of proposed theories. Initial speculations on what caused the burst, included secret weapons tests conducted behind the moon or some sort of unusual solar activity. Later, when astronomers realized these bursts were coming from all directions, they thought these signals may be transmissions from extraterrestrial civilizations or flashes from extragalactic alien warfare!    

And…. truth is, we still don’t know exactly what causes these so-called “gamma ray bursts.” Thousands of observational and theoretical papers have been written about GRBs, and now we think they occur when extremely massive stars explode or when two compact objects such as neutron stars or black holes merge together. 

Astronomers now know that they are the most energetic explosions in the Universe, and they come from distant galaxies far beyond the Milky Way. And during the milliseconds to minutes that they last, GRBs release as much energy as the Sun releases during its entire ten billion year lifetime.

While estimates vary, GRBs are expected to happen once every 100,000 to 1,000,000 years in our own galaxy. If a GRB were to occur near the solar system and facing Earth, it could cause mass extinction. In fact, some researchers argue that a GRB already caused a mass extinction, millions of years ago.

So while the US didn’t find any existential threat from the Soviet Union, and the search for answers about the GRB has gone on well past the Cold War,  it did discover a much more catastrophic possible end to life as we know it.
